  (:documentation "`trivial-toplevel-commands' allows (un)defining new toplevel commands.

There are three macros defining new commands:

- `define-command/string' to define commands that process a single
  string argumentâ€”the rest of the command invocation.
 - `define-command/read' macro binds a new command that processed the
   arguments passed to it without evaluating them.
 - And `define-command/eval' doing the same but with arguments
   evaluated.

`remove-command' unbinds the defined command. By full name or alias.

See function/macro docstrings and README file for usage examples.

TODO: Examples should belong to macros/functions/package themselves,
not to the README..."))
